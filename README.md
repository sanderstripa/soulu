## Soulu

Soulu is an experimental browser for Windows built on Chromium and CEF.

The project grew from the idea of creating a browser where the interface does not take up half of the screen, settings are located where you expect to find them, and VPN is part of the browser itself without interfering with the Windows system proxy.

Soulu is currently in the Beta stage and is actively evolving.

## What already works

### Custom interface

Soulu uses a compact top bar where tabs, the address bar, and the main actions are combined into a single space.

Two interface modes are available:

**Main** — Soulu’s compact panel.

**Classic** — a more familiar browser layout.

Light and dark themes are supported, as well as Windows-style frosted transparency.

### Chromium + CEF

The browser uses Chromium through Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF), while the native Soulu shell handles the window, interface, and Windows integration.

Soulu Beta 1.0.59 retains stable CEF 154.0.33 / Chromium 154.0.8037.94.
See [CEF_UPGRADE.md](CEF_UPGRADE.md) for dependency provenance, runtime checks
and the mandatory release gates.

### Profiles

Soulu supports separate profiles with independent:

- cookies;
- cache;
- web sessions;
- local site data.

An incognito mode is also available.

### Start page

You can keep the new tab page blank or specify your own URL that Soulu will open on startup.

### VPN

Soulu includes its own built-in VPN layer.

Xray and Sudoku configurations are supported.

The VPN works inside Soulu and does not change the Windows system proxy settings.

### Address bar

The address bar combines URL input and search, and uses suggestions from history, bookmarks, open tabs, and the search engine.

### History and browsing data

Use **History** in the top-toolbar context menu or **Ctrl+H** to search and filter
profile history, open visits and delete entries. **Ctrl+Shift+Delete** opens the
clearing dialog. History supports six time ranges; cookies/site data and cache
are explicitly cleared for all time. Private visits are never recorded.
See [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md) for backend details and limitations.

### Native menus and local translation

Browser menus share Soulu's native Onest menu surface, including web-page,
link, image, media, editing, tab, bookmark and toolbar menus. It follows the
browser theme, supports nested menus and keyboard navigation, and exposes
labels and states to Windows accessibility services.

Choose **Translate to Russian** in a page menu or use the translation button
on a foreign-language page. Soulu Translate processes visible page text locally
in a Bergamot WASM worker. The first use downloads the required Mozilla model;
verified models are cached for offline use after a browser restart. Supported
routes are English → Russian, Russian → English and German → English, with
German → Russian through English. Unsupported routes are reported explicitly.

**Show original** restores text without reloading. Form values, editable text
and code are excluded. Always/never rules are saved per profile; private-tab
rules are discarded when that private tab closes. Only model files are fetched
from Mozilla's public model bucket; page text is not sent to a translation API.
See [MENU_TRANSLATE.md](MENU_TRANSLATE.md) for architecture, provenance,
limitations and verification commands.

## Download

The latest version is always available in the **Releases** section.
